# BloodyBits
A system to make combat more visceral by having damage that can actually be seen. No more need for health bars or 
numbers displayed above entities to know how much damage you are doing!

I've always had a strong dislike towards damage numbers in most (not all) games. Games that can communicate to the player
the damage they are doing, or receiving, in a more immersive way always felt like a better experience to me
(see: DOOM Eternal, Left 4 Dead, or more recently Helldivers 2). So, I've set out to make my own version of that 
experience in minecraft.

There have been several mods that add blood in the past, but none like this. Enemies will spray blood based on the amount
of damage caused, and their models will become increasingly bloodier as they take more damage to communicate to the player
how close they are to death. Certain enemies will have certain blood colors such as red for most enemies, green for 
bug-like enemies, purple for ender-like enemies, and so on. All the colors are fully customizable within the configs
as well.
